### HOW TO SEED WITH CLOUDINARY...don't do this or find a better way.
# -1. cloudinaryresources = Cloudinary::Api.resources("max_results" = [number_images_we_have])
# 0. have to get cloudinary metadata for checksums of images (can only do by Tier 2 membership-fuck that)
#     OR you know all the checksums in advance in another file.
# 1. get an image by:
#     cloudinaryexample = cloundinaryresources["resources"][index]
# 1. Create Blobs using new_blob = ActiveStorage::Blob.new
# 2. need to assign:
#     new_blob.key = cloudinaryexample["public_id"]
#     new_blob.checksum = "checksum_string...good luck getting this from cloudinary"
#     new_blob.content_type = "image/jpeg"
#     new_blob.byte_size = cloudinaryexample["bytes"]
#     new_blob.filename = "somefilename.jpg"
# 3. then do new_blob.save
# 4. get a review by
#       examplereview = Review.find(:id)
# 5. create new photo by
#       addphoto = examplereview.photos.new
# 6. then add the required values
#       addphoto.blob_id = new_blob.id
# 7. now save by
#       addphoto.save
#   Voila! What a fucking mess...
